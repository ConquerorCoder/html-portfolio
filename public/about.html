<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Since the age of 14, my fascination towards the software industry has pushed me to learn more about what software engineers do and what they're all about. Hi, my name is Christian Daniel and I graduated from UTD with a bacheolor's in computer science. I am efficient in C++, Java, and Python as well as HTML. I am also minoring in mathematics, and I am passionate about it. The reason software engineering and programming interest me so much is because of the vast applications I can do with it in the real world. If I want to build my own site it can be done, if I want to create a game it can be done, the application to this career is endless, and the opportunities it offers are too good to pass.</p>

<p>Skills: I have vast experience in Web Design and Software Engineering. What can i do for you? I can make anytype of website you want, anytype of game application you want, anytpe of anything that relates to the Internet! Let me know your budget and I will let you know what type of site or application i can offer you!</p>
